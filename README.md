# Computer-Architecture-CSC-230
My imperfect solutions for the assignments in the CSC 230 course. 

# Note: 
If you're a student currently taking this course and you truly want to learn about computer architecture, copying/looking at my solutions for your similar assignment will be a terrible idea. Also beware that if you can find the above solutions on the internet so can your instructor. So plagiarize at your own risk. 

# PS:
I have pulled many allnighters in the lab in succession to do these assignments. Hard work might not always reward you with 100% success, but the sweat resulted from your grind will 10/10 times make you satisfied.
